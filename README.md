# Performing-a-Vulnerability-Assessment

## Objective
In this lab, I will use Nmap commands within the Zenmap application to scan the virtual network and identify the devices on the network and the operating systems and services running on them. I will also use Nessus to conduct a vulnerability assessment and record the high-risk vulnerabilities identified by the tool. Finally, I will use the information I gathered from the report to discover mitigations for those risks and make mitigation recommendations based on my findings. 
### Skills Learned
- Conduct scanning and enumeration on the network using Zenmap.
- Perform an internal vulnerability assessment scan on a target host using Nessus.

- Assess the findings of the vulnerability assessment scan, identify risks, and make recommendations for mitigation.
- Conduct an approved penetration test as an external auditor using Nmap and OpenVAS.
- Prepare a formal penetration test report.

### Tools and Software Used
- Nmap/Zenmap
- Nessus
- OpenVAS/Greenbone Security Manager

### Topology
- vWorkstation (Windows: Server 2022)
- Switch01 (Linux: Debian 11)
- FileServer01 (FreeBSD)
- pfSense-office (FreeBSD)
- pfSense-dc (FreeBSD)
- DomainController01 (Windows: Server 2019)

- GSM (Linux: Greenbone OS)

### Lab Overview
STEP 1 of this lab has three parts, which should be completed in the order specified.
 
- Ports/Hosts tab from the SYN scan for fileserver01.securelabsondemand.com
- Host Details tab from the OS scan for fileserver01.securelabsondemand.com
- Ports/Hosts tab from the Service scan for fileserver01.securelabsondemand.com
- Nessus report summary. 
- Summarize the vulnerability you selected, including the CVSS risk score, and recommend a mitigation strategy.

STEP 2
- Results of the traceroute command
- Results of the Nmap scan with OS detection activated
- Detailed OpenVAS scan results 
- Your penetration test report
